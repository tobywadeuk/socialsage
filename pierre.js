      "If you want your woman to be onboard with your vision - do NOT tell her the logical pieces of the puzzle...\nAs humans we have two modes of thinking - System 1 & System 2.\nThis is also called Fast & Slow thinking.\nCheck out nobel prize winner Daniel Kahneman for groundbreaking research into this, he's one of the most influential thinkers in my ideas and models of mastering relationships and masculinity.\nWhen presenting your vision of the future, don't tell her a bunch of figures and events - paint a picture.\nIf you sit down and break down every single little detail you will engage her system 2 - the slow, \"thinking\" part of her brain.\nIt'll come off as weak, uninteresting and like you're overcompensating for something - as a result, she will lose trust in your vision.\nInstead - paint a picture.\nStorytelling, metaphors and causal catalysts for why you will achieve it and why it's great for both you and her.\n4 years ago I started researching mythology and why ideas from The Bible and The Quran still make people go to war, create political polarization and divide nations.\nI studied the secrets behind Disney and super hero movies.\nAnd I studied phenomena like Harry Potter, Apple & Elon Musk.\nWhat I found was that storytelling, metaphors and symbolicism is not just more effective communication - it's what we are hardwired to understand!\nYou MUST master the ability to get points across through stories, otherwise, you are doing her a huge disservice by not providing the type of leadership she deserves.\nSo, instead of rambling off facts about why your idea or vision is so grandiose and fantastic, find out how you can fit it into a powerful NARRATIVE!\nThis is truly a superpower once you really master it, and that's why this will be a core element of the retreats. But you can practice this any time you like!\nStudy great stories and mythology, decipher why it's captivating millions of people, and figure out how you can use it in your own life!",

No difference.\nYou must master these things. It's just how the female brain is wired. It's neuroscience and biology, folks.\nCan't wait to roll out these retreats and the mastermind.

    B: "She does NOT want to be in a relationship with \"her best friend\"\nWomen reject men because they see nice guys as \"friends\".\nWhen girls say this \"I want to be able to be best friends with my partner\" it means a few things...\nOne thing being; They see the man they're with as above them, they look up to him, and so if he's being really nice and takes her with her on adventures, meeting his friends, etc - it makes her really happy.\nThink about when one of the cool kids in high school, maybe a senior who's also captain of the football team - someone you looked up to - and he wanted to hang out with you.\nTHAT is what they mean, that's the feeling.\nNot the feeling you get when you have a laugh together with your nerd buddies in chess club.\nBut someone they look up to who's taking them with them to cool events and meet cool people.\nIt's all about \"Becoming her Hero\".\nDon't confuse these things boys\n--\n\"Something else to add to this and please correct me if I’m wrong. I don’t women need a “shoulder to cry on”. It’s one thing for her to open up and be vulnerable with you but another thing for the man to be her emotional tampon/\ntherapist.\"\n- --\nThis is highly contextual. Is she being toxic to herself or does she truly need you to support her? Sometimes holding space is needed. However at other times she is wallowing in sadness and it's your job as a leader to help her snap out of it.\nThis is one of those big misconceptions that may make you \"cold\" (in a bad way) because you're AFRAID of being an emotional tampon. Lots of anti-nice-guy-propaganda is teaching you to NEVER let her cry on your shoulder.\nShe needs love, and sometimes listening to her vent is the love she needs. But you also need to know when she's vented enough and it's time to get over it.\n--\nLet's say you date a girl who suddenly started getting bullied by other women at her workplace because they're jealous of her beauty and charisma (real example of one of my exes). I listened first until she felt safe, seen, heard, etc. Then I asked her what she wanted from me, she asked me how to deal with it. So I coached her in some MEAN fucking frame control and taught her how to fuck those bitches up and make them eat every fuking word.\nEventually one resigned and the other two became submissive little puppies. We owned that shit.\nPart of being with a man like me is that if shit goes down I'll win every war we ever get into. And she knows that. We go to war together and I'll fuck anybody up for her, psychologically, physically, financially, doesn't matter.",

    B: "Not deeply understanding female psychology is like running a business and not understanding sales, marketing, law, finance, management and tech.\nIf you're in a relationship (or even dating a girl casually, or ever will be) and you don't understand the complex nuances of female psychology, feminine polarity and your counterpart of it - you're setting yourself up for a HUGE surprise.\nWhat kind of surprise do you say?\nImpossible to predict.\nBut common ones are:\n- She sleeps with her boss\n- She sleeps with some random guy\n- She sleeps with YOUR boss (I'll tell you a story about this one day, it's not pretty but serves as a warning, an ex-client broke my heart telling me this)\n- She sleeps with one of your \"friends\"\n- She sleeps with someone you hate (potentially the worst of all of these)\n- She simply loses attraction and breaks up...potentially taking half your assets if you're married and may also seize custody of children of you have come that far\nThe thing is this though...\nWe cannot predict when what or with whom she might do any of these.\nIf we lie to ourselves thinking that \"she's just a good woman\" then we are setting ourselves up for a nasty wake up call.\nIf you kid yourself and pretend you know things you don't know, then you're not understanding how human behavior fucking works.\nIf, however, you understand that behavior is irrational, unpredictable, and utterly impossible to predict, then you might have a chance.\nSo, what's the solution? Being paranoid?\nNo. Being paranoid is actually increasing the chances of this behavior as well because it creates self-fulfilling prophecies (more on that another time, there's actually a way to induce positive self-fulfilling prophecies, but you gotta have all the \"basics\" of masculine leadership down pat first, so I'll leave that for now).\nThe solution, my friend, is to put yourself in the only position known to actually reduce the chances of these experiences to - close to - none.\nI say close to because there's no way of 100% eliminating them. It's just part of life, unfortunately.\nObviously, the upcoming mastermind will go into incredible depth and analysis about this stuff, as well as take members as case studies and give you all personalized, completely tailored strategies and action plans to make this happen in current future relationships. But I'll try to unpack it quickly here anyway, although one single article could never unpack such a huge and complex topic.\n1. Submissiveness\nThe first thing that must happen is for her to become, and STAY, submissive to you.\nWhat does this mean?\nIt means she relinquishes power VOLUNTARILY and gives up control to you.\nShe simply follows your lead, she gives you total permission to lead and call the shots.\nThis happens due to a combination of social dominance, effective leadership, being seen as a leader of other men, and many other things.\nThe simplest thing you can do right now is to train yourself to stay completely relaxed and at ease in any situation, and learn to calmly manage yourself and yourself in an effective way without ever getting rattled.\nIt's a combination of total relaxation (I teach something called \"4 Layers Of Relaxation\" that's at the core of this) and intelligently strategizing your life with clear action plans and even clearer contingency plans (this is all part of the Inevitability Planning methodology I've mentioned several times in here, it's a methodology of planning your life that I created back in 2013 to crush it with game, business, fitness, martial arts, etc. All went to plan as well, so it's thoroughly tested and fucking WORKS, it gets the result even if life throws you a few curveballs)\n2. Having a USP\nUSP: Unique Selling Point\nEssentially I'm saying, \"be able to offer something that other men can't\".\nIt could be incredible mind-blowing experiences in the bedroom (for those of you attended an SQL event in past know, if you haven't - contact my brother https://m.facebook.com/mioch23?groupid=2861111517242002&refid=18&__tn__=%2As-R, he will turn you into a god in the bedroom).\nIt could be INCREDIBLE social dominance, making her feel small, safe, protected thanks to your dominance.\nIt could be an amazing ability at created extreme intensity and extreme variety in emotions (this is so fucking powerful it's not even funny, once you see the effect of given women these truly mind-blowing emotional roller coasters you realize how different women are from men, they fall in love in 2 days and keep falling more and more in love for every month that goes by, from nothing but this, which is why I created a huge framework around giving her emotions based on bringing out different female archetypes in her all throughout the day, week, month)\n3. Feeling cared for\nStudies actually show that a huge chunk of women who cheat, do so because of their man being too cold.\nA lot of guys from PUA and red pill communities think that women only cheat on beta males.\nWRONG!\nIf she feels neglected and lacks true intimacy she will cheat, just as she will cheat on a man she doesn't respect.\nThe truth is that no one wants to be with someone who doesn't care about them.\nThis is why quality time, seeing the inner child (another technique I created, I'll talk more about this another time, it's pretty complicated to explain over text, but essentially you tap into the inner child of the person in front of you, get a huge surge of serotonin inside you and the other person can literally feel it, trust and connection goes through the fucking roof! It'll be like nothing you've ever experienced before, it's like being on drugs) and other more \"comfort\" type things are equally important to your more manly endeavors like not taking her shit etc.\nIn the words of Jocko, \"It's a DICHOTOMY\".\nAnyway, more shit coming soon. I will try to unpack a few of these frameworks more in-depth, but to be honest you can just start playing around with this stuff on your own until the mastermind and the retreats start rolling out. I figured all of this shit out on my own...obviously it also took me 13 fucking years (lol), but anyone can get started on their own!\nAlso, send me your questions regarding this stuff. What is a challenge you're having at the moment that you'd like my help with? I want to know what you guys are going through so that I can help you as much as possible.",

    B: "For young men looking to crush it in life: Here are some habits that have contributed to my success...\nNot doing any introduction here, most of you in here know me well, so you know I've had quite a journey and had lots of success in multiple areas of life. Here are the main keys to what I've achieved:\n1. The Path of Most resistance\nThe path of most resistance - the way I see it - has 3 components:\nWhatever is the most intimidating\nWhatever is the most difficult\nWhatever is the most understimulating/boring\nI will go into depth about this in the retreats, but for now this is really all you need to know. Write out what tasks are involved in the path of most resistance on YOUR journey. Write down 1-2 weekly tasks under each of the 3 subsegments. Spend 60-80 hours a week doing only those tasks, combined with the other habits in this article. I guarantee you'll be successful unless you quit too early or suffer from very low intelligence.\nYou keep reading the classic and following the path of most resistance. Then you keep a....\n2. Studying great books.\nThis does NOT mean reading bunch of books all day. It's NOT \"1 book a day\".\nThis means finding the core 7-15 books in your chosen field and reading them over and over again.\nYou keep re-reading them constantly as you walk the path of most resistance. Every time you re-read a classic it will mean something different thanks to having more deep experience.\n3. Mastery Journal\nEvery evening write down:\nWhat did I do well today\nWhat did I do better than yesterday\nWhat can I do to improve 1% tomorrow?\nRead last night's entry in the morning and execute.\n4. Build a tribe of Brother's In Arm's...\nI owe more of my success to this than almost anything else...\nFrom day dot I've always built incredible mastermind crews.\nI built my first one before I even turned 18, and I've kept building them ever since.\nYou find a solid 4-6 guys who are going to make it big and who want to have a team around them. You make sure you all have complimentar strengths and weaknesses.\nThis post isn't about how to build this group, it's just to make you aware. The entire blueprint to building one of these is a 2-3 hour seminar I used to give in Sweden. Hopefully I'll have time to record it for the group soon -ish. But as you know there's a lot of other stuff I'm creating atm.\nBut it's really nothing to lose. Learn by trial and error. Just start one. Fail. Learn. Repeat.\nWhich leads me to my next habit...\n5. Become a master at drawing wisdom out of failure\nEvery time you fail - sit down and reflect (with both your mastermind crew and by re-reading the classics). Create an improved strategy and execute again, but WRITE DOWN THE LESSONS! The more painful the failure the more wisdom there is to extract!\n6. Inevitability Planning\nLong story short: Find all the 80/20 habits and spend 80 hours a week doing them. Make your 24 hours in the day create a trajectory where your goal becomes inevitable.\nAgain, this post is about making you aware of the habits, I have this seminar recorded somewhere, also a 2 hour one. I'll see if I can find it and post here.\n7. Be of service to the world\nAlways do something useful and make sure other people have a great experience of being in touch with you. This will set the foundation for a great network later in life! Cannot be emphasized enough!\nThere are more, but following these 7 will without a doubt help you crush almost any avenue of life!\nBest of luck,\nPierre",

    B: "\"By the way...I sort of have a boyfriend..\" she said, 30 seconds after she swallowed my...you-know-what...\nRevealing: A simple mindset shift that keeps women attracted for years and years and prevents cheating (for real)\nThis tiny shift in your perception will INSTANTLY make your woman realize that you're the best genetic choice she has...and, thus, keeps her painfully loyal, submissive and loving to you until the end of fucking time\nMany years ago was dating this gorgeous blonde Swedish girl who happened to be \"officially\" together with a 29 y/o millionaire in the music industry.\nDuring this time I accidentally discovered a really interesting mindset that changed everything I do in relationships.\nFirst a disclaimer: I don't condone sleeping/dating girls in relationships. Today I wouldn't do this, but I was different back then. I didn't know she had a boyfriend when we first hooked up and once I found out I was interested in finding out more about what drove her to cheat like that.\n(And even though it's through questionable behaviour, these experiences are the reason why I've been able to create these retreats, so that I can help guys avoid this shit. The retreats aren't even launched yet I have over a dozen guys messaging me they're ready to put down money. The reason? Because I did all this dark, semi-evil shit and now have the ability to teach things that literally nobody else in the world teaches. In the end I'm finally able to turn this into doing good. But don't think I condone this behaviour or that you even need to do it yourself. I WILL damage you when you're doing it. It truly does and I paid the price for it. It's really fucking bad for your soul. I'm not kidding.)\nIn any case, so I'm dating this girl and a few others. But this one is the only one in a relationship at the time.\n(I had 5 \"semi-girlfriends\" during this time and meeting about one new girl per week outside of this rotation. So I had the opportunity to test various types of behaviour simultaneously in all five 'relationships' and observe patterns in their responses. I've truly been a mad fucking scientist in my journey of understanding masculine-feminine dynamics for these past 13 years.)\nAnd I kept asking her about her boyfriend, trying to figure out why she'd cheat. It's a bit of a story for another day, but she introduced him to me, lying that I was an old friend from high school (we were both from another city, so he couldn't verify this), in his apartment, waiting for him to go to work, so that we could bang all night in the apartment he paid for. Pretty disgusting. I felt very weird during the entire situation, but I literally forced myself just to understand more.\nAnd here's something I noticed that he did - a lot:\nHe had a mindset of \"I must be on guard/on watch to make sure she doesn't cheat\".\nWhenever she spoke about other guys hitting on her, he clearly tried to show her how he's better.\nHe actively tried to make them sound unsuccessful, beta, weak, desperate, etc etc. It SHOWED.\n(He never really did with me though, lesson here is: You never know where the actual threat is coming from.)\nAnd this mindset showed her that she really is the price.\nWhen I date a girl and she tells me about some guy hitting on her or whatever, I literally laugh as if it's absolutely INCONCEIVABLE that:\nHe could even get her even if I wasn't her man, and,\nEven if he could get her, he'd NEVER be able to compete with me even if the girl would normally go for him\nAnd I literally carry this mindset with me. At all times.\n\"Competition doesn't exist for me. I'm so far above everybody else that there is no competition, nothing to fear, nothing to be concerned about.\"\nThis is something I taught one of my mentoring clients, a guy in New York. He's a really successful lawyer with a GORGEOUS fucking girlfriend. And he said she'd brought up other guys hitting on her recently, and despite \"crushing them\" (his words) she seemed to keep bringing them up.\nShe felt his insecurity, I explained, and then further explain this \"above the competition\" paradigm. It took some explaining and working through some emotional resistance, but eventually he actually really absorbed it.\nNow she never mentions anything and according to him he can actually already tell the difference in attraction and how submissive she is compared to before.\n(This, the emotional aspect of owning these mindsets, is the reason the retreats next year will not be regular \"workshops\". It'll be rituals with a shadow worker, lots of symbolic training and deep, unconscious work. It's one thing to know what to do, it's another to give yourself permission to truly LIVE it, BE it, and OWN it.)\nAnyway, this is such a common problem, especially among red pillers and PUAs.\nStop worrying.\nYou're ABOVE the competition.\nThe reason for this comes down to the pre-supposing frame and the level of self-esteem it implies.\nPlus, they found that something like 80% of your worries never happen, at least not in the way that you thought they would.\nLife is predictably unpredictable.\nBut more on that later.\nHope this is something you guys can adopt easily, it's a true game changer!",

    B: "\"Ignore that sudden, weird growth on your neck with bruises around it while you also for no reason - suddenly and coincidentally - also got intense fever and coughing up blood, no reason to check your blood work or do any x-rays\"\nSaid no fucking doctor ever.\nImagine if that happened?\nYou go to the doctor with some extremely dramatic symptoms that point to an aggressive terminal illness - what would you think? That you were fine? No. You'd think he should lose his license and you need to see another doctor who doesn't belong in a mental hospital.\nIt's still the way a lot of men today deal with their relationships.\nTheir woman expresses concern.\nIt could range from her becoming cold after you've been showering her with (needy) attention, or her complaining that you're cold and distant (it's NOT good, despite what a lot of PUA and red pill theory tells you, although there's a time and a place to tell her to shut up because you gotta work, but that's another story)\nIf you're in a relationship, just dating a girl, or simply just have a casual fuckbuddy then this shit applies to you.\nAs a leader you must ALWAYS listen, with empathy, to your people.\nWhether you're a general at war, a CEO in business, or just a man leading his woman/family.\nThis is why one of the core things I'll be teaching at the retreats is the \"Seeing the inner child\" method, but what you can do until then is this:\n1. Become aware of her emotions. BEFORE she even raises an issue, become aware that her body is stiff, that she's being needy or cold or clingy or frustrated or sad, and call it out.\n2. Then, sit there, listen. NOT trying to give fucking advice like a self-proclaimed fucking life coach douchebag asshole. Just. Fucking. Listen.\n3. Ask follow-up questions. Make sure you get every single angle.\n4. Repeat it all back to her, but in your own words. Explain her problem better than she can herself.\n5. Usually the problem now disappears. If not she will usually ask for advice and guidance. Now make a decision of whether it feels right to guide her here or not. Usually it is, but it may not be. Depending on the type of problem. (If she's upset Becky at work wore the same dress as her or some other dumb female shit then tell her to suck it up and go talk to her friends, but if it's legit shit then you help her.)\n6. If it's just purely emotional issues - stress, anxiety, fear, etc - then help her deal with it. I've got a method of watching your emotions until they dissolve that I teach my clients but I also teach my girls this. They usually feel incredible liberated by my doing a guided visualization that dissolves the pain. This is the kind of shit that makes them REALLY fall in love and see what an incredible leader you are. You become like a god.\n7. Practice Metta Meditation daily to develop more compassion. Check out Mathieu Richard's book \"Altruism\". It's a 700 page book on the SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (empirical shit, large studies) on metta meditation, compassion, being altruistic etc. A very large part of how I do business, interact with women and coach clients come from putting myself into a state of deep compassion and focusing on how to serve altruistically. I'm ALWAYS rewarded. Just don't misconstrue altruism for weakness. I'm not a fucking hippy who allows people to take advantage of me. I'm still a fucking g and I don't tolerate bullshit. But unless someone has done anything I'm one of the nicest, kindest people you'll meet. (And obviously super humble lol). To me the greatest joy in life is the deep meaningful and fulfilling sensation I get when a woman I'm dating is truly blossoming and becoming better thanks to things I've done for her, and when my clients overcome deep pain and start living better lives and having a better impact on the world around them. There's nothing that will EVER make you more effective at your craft than that either. I'll stop preaching now, but, yeah...check out that shit. I'll talk a LOT more about this in 2020.\nSpeak soon!\n- Pierre \"The Buddhist Stripper\" de Sousa",

And, hopefully, I can help a lot of you guys to get to this realization much, much faster than that.\nI discovered that Attraction, Sex & Love should go UP as your relationship progresses - not down\n...if you do things the right way.\nA lot of people think it's \"just the way things work\" when they or people they know talk about how they're only intimate 2-3 times/month after a few months/years of dating.\nAs if women just get comfortable and lose interest after a while.\nWell...\nYou could argue that this is correct if you look at the general pattern in society.\nHowever, you're missing the silent evidence - the counter thesis.\nThere are plenty of relationships where the opposite happens.\nThey become more attracted, more aroused and more in love the longer they day CERTAIN men.\nThese relationships happen to be the same ones where the woman won't cheat...\nImagine you meet a girl who in your eyes is an \"8\" (crude term, but I'm just making a point here, so spare me the moralizing).\nYou get to know her, you date for a while, you fall in love.\nAfter 3 years she's (for whatever reason) gone from an 8 to a 10.\nPLUS\nShe untrained her gag reflex (you know what I mean)\nShe did kegels and got even tighter\nShe started bringing you other girls to do threesomes and orgies with as long as you don't bang anyone without her being around for it\nAnd she took cooking classes and a massage class so that she can take even better care of you and support you better\nShe started doing meditation to become better at giving you space just so that you could feel even more free and build your business\nAnd maybe a couple more things, but let's stop here.\nWould you \"get bored\" or \"comfortable\" here?\nIf you're a man with your head screwed on right, then you'd stay loyal to her while crushing your business and hitting the gym like a mad man, along with other things. You'd never risk losing this, right?\nExactly.\nWomen work the same way.\nIf you want love, attraction, arousal etc to increase month after month, year after year, then you have to be the male equivalent of what I just described!\nBecome more attractive, more masculine, more dominant, more successful, more well-connected, more loving, more grounded, more fearless, more pre-selected, etc etc for every month that goes by as well.\nShe wants a man who's on his fucking purpose and keeps crushing it in life.\nNot some pathetic little idiot who's complacent.\nIn every single relationship I've had this has been the pattern.\nGirl becomes more infatuated, more aroused and more attracted the longer we date.\nAnd to be honest - it's the same for me as well!\nI love them more, feel more attracted, and become more protective (not jealousy based protection out of fear, but lovingly wanting to keep them safe and help them blossom).\nAnd it all comes down to one thing - truly becoming her fucking Hero.\nThere's just no other way around it.\nTomorrow I'll discuss more about becoming her hero through understanding that humans have a bottom-up dominance hierarchy, and why that's important to understand.\nOnce you understanding what that means and the implication of it, then you'll understand why being domineering is a short-term recipe that will set you up for long-term failure.\nCompassionate dominance is the way, fear-based domineering is the enemy!\nTalk more tomorrow!\nPierre",

Romantic relationships (Game, dating, \"relationships\", etc)\n2. Platonic relationships (friends, dealing with difficult people, networking, sales, clients, business partners, employees, etc)\n3. Your relationship with yourself (self-esteem, confidence, overcoming limiting beliefs, etc)\n(And, you could also argue, you have a fourth: Relationship with God/the divine/a higher power.\nBut the fourth one isn't one I teach at all because I personally don't have that relationship worked out.\nThe other three, especially the first two, are what I've spent my life mastering.)\nWhat I found is that mastering these 3 didn't just give me an incredible social power, but also incredible powers in business and as a coach as well. I didn't initially intend for that to happen, I started out on this journey just to master relationships, I didn't know I'd end up in business or end up coaching this stuff.\nBut eventually it turned out this gave me incredible insight into how people work, and it gave me powers to guide people to overcome problems in their own life, and I learned how to sell and communicate and negotiate in business situations.\nBut more important than understanding these types of relationships is to understand that the quality of your relationships is decided by the quality of your communication.\nAnd this is where things get interesting.\nBecause now we can discuss - what actually IS communication, and what decides the quality of it?\nHere's communication, in three categories:\n1. Listening\n2. Speaking\n3. Questioning.\nAnd it's the third one that most people screw up the most, because it's not as sexy as the other two (especially the second one).\nIn the last year I've been doing very deep unconscious work by mastering the art of asking myself better questions.\nSo here's a challenge to you all:\nWhat is one question you should ask yourself but you don't because you're afraid of what answer might come to mind?\nNow sit down for an hour with that question in your mind.\nPitch black room. No electronics. And be okay with WHATEVER answer may arise from your unconscious.\nThis is scary, but it's powerful as fuck.\nYou may be faced with truths about why you do certain things, certain influences you allow into your life, or if you're actually doing good or bad for the world as a whole.\nIt could end up being very, very confronting. But, as a man, that's just part of the journey.",

No hesitating. No retracting into your own mind.\nZero spike in cortisol.\nZero dip in serotonin and oxytocin.\nAnd, on top of all this, if it's the right course of action, you may do or say things that will increase the social pressure and even direct all of it to yourself.\nMaybe you'll take all pressure off everyone else and shoulder it all on your own - without batting an eye and with zero hesitation.\nThis is true leadership, it makes women attracted and men admire you.\nBut more than any of that, it makes you a better person and you inspire others to have the courage to be loving no matter what happens.\nAnd the best part is that this is just the beginning stages of true masculine development - barely scratching the damn surface.\nAnd that's why I'm grateful to get to do the work I do.

    B: "The ONE THING You Need To Attract Women Without Changing Who You Are\nUnapologetically owning your sexuality.\nYeah.\nIt’s literally that fucking simple.\nWhy?\nLet’s begin by looking at female BIOLOGY.\n1. They are even more sexually driven than we are once this pet of them is engaged (it’s just harder to engage it in them than in us)2. Female hypergamy is off the charts. It’s so powerful most men have a hard time even accepting it without getting jaded.3. Women are more driven by emotion than us, and as we all know; sexual arousal is the most power driver in all of humanity\nIf you can just communicate:1. You know what she’s like sexually2. You don’t judge it but instead love it3. You can handle it (<—- biggest frustration women have is they feel men can’t handle them)4. Sex is not a big deal\n...then attracting a quality woman (or women) into your life is absolutely effortless.\nIn fact, back when I taught “Pickup” I had an entire script that took me from “Hello” to literally choking girls and making them call me Daddy in less than 5 minutes.\nAnd it was so effective I usually slept with one out of three girls I approached.\nOftentimes even the first girl I approached each night.\nHow was I able to do that?\nThree reasons:\n1. I oozed that I was a highly sexual man that fully understood female sexuality2. I also gave off an energy that I didn’t need to brag to my friends about it but rather that it was a little secret between me and women (they often verbalized this after meeting me a few times, other guys simply aren’t in this “secret society” that understands sexuality)3. I didn’t flinch or hesitate one bit even while saying things like “I can tel you’d love your hair pulled by being choked by my firm hand and made to scream that you’re my fucking property”. I’d do this right next to their friends and even bouncers.\nWhat does this do to women?\nIntense. Sexual. Arousal.\nIt’s all about playful, masculine, dominance.\nUnderstand female sexuality. Love female sexuality. And unapologetically own your own sexuality.\nIf you just do this you’ll never be without women ever again.\nHowever the key to it all is to own it in a MASCULINE way.\nNot like a curious/eager little boy.\nIt’s about owning your sexuality with zero hesitation, zero flinching, and zero fucking doubt.\nThis is also how you keep attraction alive in a long term relationship.\nAnd it is THE difference between MEN who get women effortlessly vs boys who struggle to meet women.",

    B: "There’s a certain “magic” to making conversations flow effortlessly while also being aware of where it’s going...\nIt’s both an art and a science.\nAnd it’s a skill that, once mastered, allows you to:\n- Make people talk forever about mundane subjects while they feel like you’re the most interesting person they’ve ever met - even if you only speak 5% of the time (“revenge of the introvert”)\n- Come off as naturally charismatic without even trying\n- Be the glue that makes the group as a whole forget about time and just enjoy each other’s company for hours and hours. This means that YOU are the most valuable person without having to constantly talk and be obnoxious. You’re simply the fuel that the group can’t be without.\n- Become subconsciously anchored as the “father figure” of the group. That pillar of stability and security. Or, in other words, the ACTUAL alpha of the group that EVERYONE listens to the moment he speaks. He doesn’t need to speak much either, because every word he says has so much weight. This allows your to just sit and enjoy your friends company without ever having to engage in juvenile attempts at “out alpha” other guys. You’re simply above that paradigm.\n- Make people invest not only time and effort, but to open up and become extremely vulnerable with you. I won’t get into the psychology behind this but it essentially works like putting in a lot of chips into a poker tournament; They now have “skin in the game” because they’ve told you things they don’t tell other people. They are INVESTED in you. In women this becomes attraction later on. But more on that process another time.\nAnd much much more.\nNow, what exactly am I talking about?\nGlad you asked..\nWhat I’m talking about here is the ability to make other people more interesting, talkative and charismatic.\nThis is THE most high status trait of any man I know.\nIf you can make other people fee high status, then you become high status in their eyes.\nAnd I’m sure we all know how human beings react to om high status individuals?\nRight.\nYou accomplish this feat by following a few very simple principles of AUTHENTIC listening;\n1. It’s not about YOUForget about yourself. It’s not about your role in the group.It’s not about you getting attention.And it’s NOT about how this reflects on you.\nJust listen to the other person and learn to shine the light on them, without worrying about if you get enough attention or not.\n2. Look for “hot takes”.\nWhen someone says a little remark that could be an interesting/unusual/controversial/intelligent perspective on something: Encourage him to elaborate!\nAnd don’t just go “please elaborate” like a bored college professor.\nInstead go: “MMM!! TALK TO ME!”\nReally SHOW how interesting he/she is!\nThis makes people extremely excited, it makes them feel smart/important, and it gets them to speak with lots of enthusiasm.\nAll of this lowers cortisol and increases dopamine and serotonin which are the two most powerful neurotransmitters in social situations.\nPlus!\nThey will also condition themselves to associate dopamine & serotonin with YOU (check out classic conditioning if you don’t know how this works, but I’ll make a big post about this in the future too).\nMeaning that you will be a source of the very same emotions/chemicals that cause people to get addicted to COCAINE!\nYeah, pretty damn powerful.\n3. Lift them up! Make your team better!\nFind the unique strengths in people around you and focus on them. Build people up!\nSomething I learnt from over half a decade of coaching is that when I treat my clients as if they’re already a full 10/10 Superman then they start acting like it too.\nSo now I just treat everyone like that, and people really become BETTER from it.\nThis is an incredible way of actually making a small impact on the world on a daily basis.\nAnd, what’s more, is that people feel so much better about themselves like this and they’ll have you to thank for you.\nGuess who they ALL want to be around?\nYou!\nYou’ll literally have people fighting to be close to you. Which creates social proof which, in turn, increases status, power & influences\nBy just lifting people up!\nCrazy.\n4. Inclusion.\nMake sure that everyone in the group gets included.\nSome people are naturally loud, don’t worry about them.\nHelp the soft spoken people to speak up.\nAsk them “what’s your opinion on this?” “Didn’t you also [insert whatever you’re talking about]?” Etc\nWhat’s cool is that you become the “judge”, the guy who decides who gets to speak and who doesn’t. But no one can fault you for it because you’re not making it about yourself.\nThis, over time, makes people highly reactive to you and also super interested in YOU.\nYou’ll be asked to speak more and you can simply decide if you want to or not. Up to you. You’re just that high status guy who can take up as much space as he likes.\nThere are lots more, and I teach them all in the mentorship, but I thought I’d give out some golden nuggets to you here today.\nIn the mentorship I even show you where I learnt this and how you can study the same 3 people and possible get even better than me at this.\n(Hint: You’d be extremely surprised if you knew who I learnt this from)",

    B: "A deeper, healthier, and energetic look at how to attract your dream relationship(s):\nSomething that’s been on my mind 24/7 lately is how to boil everything I’ve learnt over 15 years into a short 3-day retreat.\nHow to teach both men and women how to attract their dream relationships (wether mono or poly) in a win-win-win approach.\nThe purpose of this movement is to heal the broken relationship between men and women.\nI’m envisioning a method that:\nTeaches men how to get the women they want, in a way that makes women trust men more, while slowly changing the perspectives they both have on the world to slowly end wars, poverty, trafficking, etc.\nAnd the same for women.\nImagine a guy who’s not the stereotypical “attractive” guy.\nHow can he get what he wants while INCREASING women’s trust of men, heal the women he meets, while raising his perspectives on the world to approach all goals in a holistic fashion that creates real transformation?(And same question for women)\nLet’s begin with his selfish goal of attracting women and finding meaning in his life:\nIf he is fully in his masculine, grounded, state of gratitude, certainty, clarity, compassion, sexual arousal, and knows how to lead authentically- he’ll attract women.\nHow do I know this?—> 15 years experience.\nIt’s not a feel good statement. It’s empirically tested. Key components of this listed below.\nIf he does it in this way then the women he meets will grow to trust men more.\nToday this is a huge issue. Men lie about not being into cheap hookups, or about making more money than they do, or about knowing celebrities without doing so, etc. It creates distrust and “buyer’s remorse”.\nWomen lie about similar shit. Creates distrust from men too. It takes two to tango, not saying it’s all men doing this.\nIn any case, this causes the “women’s movement” and the “men’s movements” to clash and point fingers at each other.\nWhich in turn makes it all just go to shit. And children are suffering, which creates a self-perpetuating cycle of disconnect, distrust, and abuse.\nBut if by leading with true benevolence, understanding exactly her feminine and her arcuhetype of feminine he can satisfy her FULLY, men can start to turn the tides on this cultural phenomenon.\nMaybe she’s more of an adventurous, or more of an innocent, or more of an outlaw, or whatever.\nDepending on this he can lead her for real.\nThe result? She’ll realize there ARE truly good men out there. Men who are honest, upfront, strong, loving, powerful, protective, caring, dominant, who will not lie to her.\nAfter this he can also, thanks to fully understanding this, teach her how to spot other men of integrity. And she can teach her friends. If women realize that not ALL men are either pussies or domineering, and that there is a way to SPOT good men, this will spark a slow but important change in how women view men.\nAnd vice versa.\nImagine meeting a women who knows how to follow, not from insecurity or attachment, but from knowing she’s a Queen and can fee that you’re a true leader (if you are, but if you’re not then don’t whine, just learn how to without cheating, that’s the actual key here), she doesn’t manipulate, she does t lie, she doesn’t whine in an entitled way (the feminine may whine some times but there’s a difference to a woman in her shadow whining vs a woman in her fullest expression being grumpy/unseen, and it’s part of your job to know when it’s time to set a boundary and call her out vs when it’s time to listen and take the call to action and satisfy her problem). Imagine she’s just really really sweet and feminine, but also doesn’t let you be a boy but inspires you to man the fuck up, yet supports you fully when you really need to recharge and she knows the difference (this is her version of knowing when you’re in your shadow and being a bitch vs when you’re in your fullest expression but need her feminine nurturing energy). All these red pill dudes would realize you CAN trust women, it’s just a matter of spotting healthy & mature vs unhealthy & immature. If she’s also gone through this training she can also help you see this and teach you how to spot in other women. This would spark a slow but important change in men as well.\nSo, both get what they want selfishly, and both help and heal the people they know, while slowly changing the culture and create better environments for children to grow up in.\nAnd then there are largely, societal, benefits to this in terms of politics but that’s beyond the scope of this post. I’ll explain that in a post about the total vision of the movement.\nSo let’s break this down, what’s the overall components of this:\nThe key to attracting women:- Be normal- Be in your fullest, most authentic, expression of your masculine- Understand her feminine and how to lead it automatically (lead like “The Good King”/The Benevolent Father, not like a tyrant or an entitlement prince)- Find the highest expression of your unique, personal, purpose- Stay in shape through martial arts and other activities that build your masculine energy, find your “archetype” to learn how express yourself through fashion, and other “shallow” stuff that can actually communicate something deeper if you do it right\nThe key to attracting men:- Be normal- Be in your fullest, most authentic, expression of your feminine- Understand his masculine and how to follow authentically (follow like a Queen, not like a princess or a spoiled brat)- Find the highest expression of your unique, personal, purpose- Stay in shape through dance and other things that build your feminine energy, find your “archetype” to learn how express yourself through fashion, and other “shallow” stuff that can actually communicate something deeper if you do it right\nIn other words:- Understand authentic communication- Understand your sexual polarity- Understand the counter-polarity- Understand how to, and master the art of, dancing with the counter-polarity\nSo there you have it. A very concise map of the components you need to attract dream partners in a way that’s good for you, good for them, and good for the world.\nI’ve written at length about various exercises, meditations, visualizations for that masculine energy.\nWith the stuff that’s already in here you should be able to transform your energy completely.\nAnd I’m currently working on detailed guides on authentic communication, archetypes, sexual polarities, polyamory, leadership, relationship management, finding your purpose, etc.\nBut don’t sit around waiting for that to be published.\nStart working on this NOW.\nCreate a daily practice. Be disciplined.\nTake 3-4 exercises from the group and put into a daily regimen.\nView it like being an athlete.\nOnly the dedicated will see change. If you don’t take transformation seriously then you can seriously forget about transformation.\n(^ that’s a bar right there)\nI’ll remain fairly inconsistent with posting for now, as well as with replying to comments.\nI’m still in the process of going really really deep into my purpose, spiritual stuff, and restructuring how I run this movement.\nBut I do read the comments, so leave your questions below because I’ll do a Q&A answering all questions shortly.\nAnd you’ll slowly start seeing me get more and more active.\nHowever I’ll probably never get back to the same activity as before, before one big change is to really hold nothing back and make all content as premium as possible. So the future posts will be “product worthy” stuff. Things you’d expect from a paid book or product. And that means it’ll take more time and effort and editing putting them together.\nBut in the end you’ll be better off for it.\nIt’ll be easier to keep up, and easier to implement.\nAnd then I can spend more time on perfecting the retreats which are now coming together amazingly.\nI’ve already run the idea past a few mentoring clients and some friends & mentors and they’re loving it. But the same goes with them, everything I do from now on will be done with patience and a TON of organized, structured, grueling attention to detail.\nSo the first retreat will likely not launch until next year.\nAs always, hope you all are doing very well, post your comments and questions below.",

But that will just be a bonus because you’ll find the real “results” much more rewarding - inner peace, true connections, and spiritual awakenings.\nJust like tantra is sexual yoga, this is social yoga.\nA path to spiritual awakening through the magic of communication yoga.\nMeta-Mantra:“How can I serve/help this person”\nThis doesn’t mean a cognitive function of “let’s teach this person XYZ thing to ‘fix’ their depression/anxiety/frustration”, it means how can you heal them energetically right now.\n“The flower loves it when you give it attention” - Eckhart Tolle\nIt’s shown in studies that giving plants pure loving awareness is good for them.\nSo it is for humans.\n“The best thing you can do is always to relax”\nThat’s one of the core reminders I teach my students because that will put you into a grounded energy that’s good for you and good for those around you.\nAlso, remember the three levels of the masculine purpose:- Internal purpose (high vibrational energy; compassion, love, peace, joy)- External purpose (direction, where to focus and direct the energy of the first level purpose)- Turning chaos into order (which is what we’re discussing now; how to heal the people/environments that you chose to direct your energy into)\nSo, to answer the meta-question again:\nThe way you serve someone, truly, is energetically.\nYou heal them.\nAnd you do this not by cognitive-based advice, but through “loving awareness” as the great Ram Dass would put it.\n(Rest in peace)\nSocial Yoga is a path of awakening, not a path of getting more validation but a path of giving and receiving non-attached love.\nIf the words spirituality and awakening sounds a bit strange, replace spirituality with happiness and awakening with true fulfillment & self-love.\nUse all the tools I’ve given you and go out and communicate in a way that puts you in these high vibrational states.\nBe creative and come up with unique exercises to put yourself into the states through socializing.",

I’ll date her friend. I’ll make her pick up other girls for me.\nI’ll mock her for taking herself too serious to the point of her tearing up and feeling almost bullied. I’ll call her out on any kind of pretentious shit I see.\nThe point is: Romance and chivalry isn’t bad - it just needs to be done in a masculine manner.\nThis is how you get ALL women to want to see you over and over again and how they allow you to do things they’d never allow any other man to do (like threesomes, flirt with the waitress in front of her, etc).\nRomance is the way, but it’s gotta be a masculine type of romance.\nIt’s about becoming her absolute fucking fantasy.\nHer knight in shining armor.\nAnd you get there through strength and absolute love for women.\nIn fact, I don’t just love women - I am in love with Woman (capital W).\nFrom this place women want you to succeed, and allow themselves to fully give themselves to you.\nYou may also call this Benevolent, Masculine Leadership.\n- Pierre",

Seek total fulfillment and satisfaction by doing Metta Meditation to increase serotonin and reach a higher vibration. Relaxation meditation for decreasing cortisol.Protect your kingdom and don't be a Captain Save-A-Ho. Other people's energy and problems aren't your responsibility. You may steer them to the right direction and be there to listen and talk. But don't try to be their therapist and try fixing them yourself.Don't set boundaries because you THINK you should. Set boundaries when you FEEL the need to set it because it's genuinely affecting you.\n2. DIRECTIONA lot of people are misdirecting themselves. They chase goals and think there is a difference between Online and Offline goals. In reality they continue to chase the same dopamine hits by looking for external solutions to internal problems.Goals aren't your purpose! How to find your purpose? Try things! Tap into your inner child. Find something that makes you cry and makes you feel excited and driven in your body as that's something everyone could get behind. But there's a difference between tears.

Just whatever is happening in the media news cycle, trends of social media, and whatever their family has programmed.\nThis is feminine. It’s just following the mass scale “programming”.\nUnderstand that your woman will likely be like this, don’t judge her for it. She’s feminine. After long enough time with you, most of your values will have become her’s, but she will always have a certain flavor of mainstream behavior and ideas because it’s simply how the feminine works.\nShe doesn’t want to be too “disruptive”, that’s your job.\nPeople wait to finish their never-ending “life project” that, once finished, then they’ll be happy.\nThis is done through perfecting their wardrobe, perfecting their house, their garden, getting abs, finishing their book list of 100 irrelevant fiction books.\nThey think reading 4 books on mainstream self help makes them understand success and happiness. They don’t understand nuance. It’s simplistic, generalist, sweeping concepts that sound good without critical thinking.\nZero empirical skepticism.\nSheep get excited about motivational 5 minute viral videos and then go back to gossiping and watching the latest Netflix trending series/documentary.\nThey hate whatever their political stance tells them to hate. They love whatever their political stance tells them to love. They pay attention to whatever masks their restless, uneventful life.\nThey want their partner and their friends to function like all other forms of entertainment in their life - to provide a hit of stimuli and help them with their Atman project.\nWithout knowing it they’re all in a hyper feminine polarity.\nAnd yes, that includes the right wing, maga-hat-wearing, Trump-touting, proud-boys-defending, red pill coaches that you think are teaching you about masculinity.\nMasculine polarity is the watcher. It observes and operates upon operating.\nIt looks at its own values, morals, habits, ideas, concepts, frameworks, emotions, moods, body, mind, heart, soul, and even its very awareness - and creates order out of this, this the chaos of the feminine.\nBecause no matter how manly you are, your thoughts, emotions, and ideas are still all part of the feminine.\nThe feminine is the leaf in the wind, it flows with the strongest current in the river. It identifies with all things, thoughts, and ideas.\nThe masculine takes a step back. Observes.

It's needed in order to speak Woman, but it's not a place to live from 24/7.\nAs a masculine leader you want a mentor, and a small, trust, circle of male friends where you can open up and be fully vulnerable.\nShare all of your insecurities, problems, anxieties, etc.\nAnd yes, do share some of these with your woman.\nBut telling her you're super worried about being able to pay the mortgage next month is NOT the way leadership is done.\nDon't download your anxieties into her so she has to be your fucking coach and make you feel like you can do this.\nThat's why you have a mentor and an inner circle.\nSo, to summarize; As always there's a dichotomy. Don't be \"Mr. Stoic\", and don't be \"Mr. Sensitive\". Have a mentor and an inner circle. And learn to speak Woman so you understand when and how to connect with her feminine by letting her into your feminine every once in a while. Learn to dance, energetically speaking.\nAll of this, and more, in the upcoming product.\n- Pierre",

    B: "What to do when you feel unhappy?\nThis is a response to Raffi, and then a subsequent answer to a follow up question by Tim. It’s good enough to be it’s own post so everyone sees it, so here you go:\nJust simple awareness does wonders.\nWhenever these darker emotions come up - observe them.\nIn the beginning it’s good to sit down and close your eyes, after some practice you can do it while doing other things.\nBegin by sitting down, closing your eyes, and just focus on the emotion.\nDon’t resist it.Don’t judge it.Don’t try to change it.\nJust sit the and feel it.\nBe really, really aware of it.\nIgnore everything else.\nDon’t analyze it.\nJust allow it to be there.\nDo this for as long as it persists. It fades out eventually.\nWhat helps me is to also do the following:\nWhere in your body is the emotion located?What color does it have?Shape?Temperature?Size?Does it move?\nAnd then go back, where is it now?What color is it now?And so on and so forth.\nJust watch it move around and shift shapes, colors, etc.\nAlso realize this: The negative emotions come from the fact that you resist something.\nAnd the cure is awareness + acceptance.\nAcceptance of selfAcceptance of the nowAcceptance of reality\n(I made a big fucking post on acceptance recently, scroll the group and look it up)\nNow understand this: As long as you chase “change” in your life you are CHOOSING these emotions.\nYou may make them go away temporarily if you’re having “wins” in your life, but they’ll come back.\nEventually you’ve had enough success to not be able to make them go away almost at all. This is when you either decide to make acceptance and spirituality a priority, or you start using drugs and other very dark forms of self-medication.\nThose around you who don’t want to accept this in themselves will feel threatened when you accept this and they’ll shame you for it. Don’t pay attention to them. Don’t try to change their minds. Understand that they’re just afraid, but distance yourself.\nLastly, understand how to create more positive emotions. All the meditations and visualizations I’ve posted in the group are examples of this.\nAlso: Yoga, spending time in nature, spending time with dogs and children, surrounding yourself with people on this same path of higher consciousness, loooong runs for the sake of happiness not for aesthetics, letting go of cognitive awareness in social interactions and instead leading with compassion and focusing on serving rather than attaining (without the cop out of pretending you’re going for “win win” as a way of rationalizing manipulation).\nThere’s more to it, but this is a great start.\nYifei Huang John Damwijk and Federico Martinez have been trained in-depth by me in these aspect in the mentorship. Read their posts in the group as of lately. They’re sharing great insights.\nLove you man, I know you’ll find your way out of this.I feel your pain, and I’m happy you’re in it, because I think this will spark your first steps into the ACTUAL journey of self discovery that’s eluded you for so long. ❤️\nThink about it like this.\nImagine you’re in a foreign country, and you need to find a market to buy food in, because you’re starving.\nBut you don’t speak their language, they don’t speak yours.\nSo when you ask for the market and they don’t understand, you try to say it in different ways, speak louder, use other words.\nYou just try to be more and more clever in how to explain where you need to go.\nBut no matter how well you explain it, they’ll never understand.\nYou can be Shakespeare himself and a true master at communication, they still won’t get it.\nYou need to learn to speak their language, because they won’t adjust to you.\nHappiness, true, deep, fulfilled, happiness, doesn’t speak your current language.\nYour entire life has been about fixing materialistic and ego-centric problems to few good enough.\nYou wanted girls. You wanted money. You wanted to travel. You wanted to feel alpha. You wanted to feel popular.\nAnd it lead to unhappiness.\nIf you want something lasting, you need something that goes beyond self-image and trying being cool.\nIt’s time to look inward.\nBut not inward in terms of confidence or “self-esteem”.\nBut looking further inside that self-esteem.\nEnergy work and spirituality is the way, not more bullshit to feel high status.\nThis is something I worked with Yifei Huang for a long ass time until he finally got it. You can see his post in the last week, he’s finally started to “get it”. Confidence etc is a great bonus but that’s NOT the focus of the stuff we’ve worked on in the past 3 months.\nLook inward. Not outward.\nQuestion: do you think that going trough the pick up process is always an ego/trying to looks cool/ thing ?\nDoesn’t have to be. What I teach in the mentorship is an integral approach to social skills combined with spirituality, energy work, philosophy, psychology and genera lifestyle design.\nMost people have a very reductionist view of these things.\nEither it’s all spiritual or it’s all material.\nI begin with emotional mastery. Then we develop self-awareness (getting to know the structure of your own ego to make it stronger, braver and more free).Then we develop social skills, but through a lens of higher consciousness to make the world a better place.Then we work on philosophy and transforming your mind to very high levels.Then we re-arrange your life so that you get total freedom and create systems of abundance so that things start to flow into your life without the constant chasing.",

Lol.\nWhen I was younger all I could see was the shell.\nBut that was just insecurity. Because I thought that banging hot girls made me “cool”.\nIt doesn’t.\nIt made me empty and shallow. And depressed.\nLooking at the qualities of the human, and connecting to that, completely unaware of what this says about me as a “man” or a “coach” or any other dumb shit is the healthiest and best thing that ever arose within me.\nAnd it will be the most liberating thing you’ll ever experience.\nYou can have a short 3 week fling and experience more love and human connection than you’ve experienced your entire life when you learn to let go of ego and be completely present.\nBecause here’s where your natural masculine polarity arises, and you trust that your instincts will do the work for you.\nLike this you can just tap into your love, desire, and natural protective instincts, and then the job is done for you.\nAs a result you do become a LOT more attractive, but more importantly - you’ll create truly meaningful relationships (even if they’re short and casual if that’s what you want right now) and start walking the path toward true fulfillment and happiness.\nI hope you’ll join me on this journey. It’s a true pleasure and liberation, and that’s why I still do this work.\nI couldn’t care less about money anymore. I couldn’t care less about traveling. Honestly I don’t really need to do anything at all. I can just sit at home and work for 3-4 hours a week and make enough to pay for my extremely minimalist lifestyle and be completely at peace (in bliss, even, much of the time).\nBut I do love helping others find liberation from the chains of validation, isolation, and sexual frustration. So I’ll be sticking around. For you.\nCome onboard, and let’s lose those chains!\nMaster course on this dropping very soon. Leaving for Austria in a week to start recording. This way I can help thousands of guys in a year, rather than just a few dozen.\nExciting times!\nTalk soon.\nMuch love,\nPierre",

    B: "Giving & Asking for Love without losing boundaries (+ the wisdom of knowing when, what, how much, and whom to give to)\nYou don’t give because you’re obliged.\nThat is not kindness.\nIt is not what Love is.\nGiving because you feel like you have to isn’t kindness, it’s lack of boundaries.\nIt’s 100% okay to refuse to give money, time, or any other form of resource.\nYou don’t need any more reason to refuse than a simple “it doesn’t feel right”.\nIf someone tries to shame you for this that’s on them.\nEven if you make a million dollars a day you don’t “have to” give a single cent to someone else.\nYou give because the realization of Love and Unity is telling you to give.\nLately I’ve been giving a lot of money away, as you all know.\nAnd, as a curious result of this, quite a few people have come and asked for a second round of donation.\nFurthermore, they haven’t asked from a place of humility and love.\nThey’ve come to me for money without a deep sense of gratitude and love.\nI haven’t felt any form of love from them.\nAll I’ve felt is an expectation.\nThat isn’t how this works.\nI’m not giving because I’m some form of a martyr.\nWhen I give, I do so because my heart is overflowing with love because someone feels extremely innocent and in a state of suffering and/or in need of food/shelter/medicine.\nLove and Unity tells you when to give, what to give, who to give it to, and how much of it to give.\nNot your mind.\nAnd when someone comes and specifically asks for ‘money’ because they think it’s going to release them from suffering, they simply don’t know what they’re asking for.\nMoney won’t cure their suffering.\nThe act of giving cures YOUR suffering when you give from Love, and it shows others that real Love exists.\nBut when things are expected and the demands are coming from the ego, then no one is really benefiting from the money.\nSame thing when I share ideas with you here on social media.\nI no longer share as a clever business strategy.\nI share because it fills me with joy and love, and/or because I’m in a Nondual state and feel called to share some wisdom that is being imparted with me from non-conceptual awareness.\nThere are secrets of asking me for money you could use so that I could never refuse you.\nBut asking from an ego-mind level is not the way.\nHowever, what would be much wiser to ask, would be “how can I remove the suffering from my pain?”.\nInstead of asking for your self-diagnosed solution to your self-diagnosed problem, why not be humble enough to ask what your problem is and what the solution is?\nThat is what I do with my own mentors.\nI meet them in love, and humbly ask for guidance.\nI don’t tell them what my problem is or what solution I want from them.\nI simply meet them in love and gratitude, and trust for them to guide me with Wisdom.\nJust some ramblings on giving and receiving. Do what you will with these words.\nHopefully you’ll be able to be served by them, and if not, simply discard. All the same anyway really.\nMuch, much, love\n- Pierre",

    B: "If you want to meet, attract, and build meaningful relationships...\nAKA your \"dream team\"...\n...without having to change who you are...\n...then you MUST think holistically.\nAnd when I say dream team, I mean all the relationships you want in your life.\nRomantic partner/partners. Business network. Friends. Connections in the nightlife/entertainment environment if you want access to certain exclusive clubs/vips/events/etc. Employees and affiliates if you're in business. Mentors. Clients.\nThat's the dream team.\nThe quality if your life is in direct proportion to the quality of your dream team, aka relationship management.\nAnd without a holistic & authentic approach to this, you'll always be a victim or short-term and/or one-dimensional success in your relationship mastery.\nBut if you do manage to build your dream team, then the world is at your feet.\nThe life I've built with no other skill than the skill of acquiring, deepen and maintain relationships is unbelievable.\nBut what I've built isn't for everyone.\nEveryone doesn't want to have to travel constantly, always be on coaching calls, and make a living by being a teacher.\nAnd that's okay, because these skills don't mean you have to live MY life.\nThey mean you can build YOUR dream life.\nSome (quite many actually) of my ex-clients are now coaches themselves, many of whom you see on these various facebook groups, and some of them have larger large YouTube channels.\nSome publicly give me cred, others aren't quite as loyal, but that's all good. It is what it is. Point is; if you want this as a career, then you can, but you don't have to.\nMany of my clients just use these relationship tools to get girlfriends (as monogamous relationships or as full-blown harems), navigate corporate environments to climb that ladder at record speed, and simply heal their inner sense of inadequacy.\nWhat you choose to use this for is up to you, but, if you want long-term sustainable success then you must think holistically.\nWhether it's to turn this into a business (for which I've created a separate business building mentorship for my ex-clients who want to become professional coaches), or if it's just to enhance your current life - you must be a holistic practitioner.\nFor this to work I've identified multiple areas to improve upon.\nIf you imagine yourself being a video game character that you can \"train\" in multiple skills/strengths, that's how I think about it.\nThe first of these being emotional/energetic.\nAnd it can be broken down into many sub-categories, such as self-love/self-acceptance, relaxation, metta, high vs low vibration, certainty, confidence, etc.\nAll the separate aspect of this category is beyond the scope of this article. The point is that working on your internals is so incredibly important and powerful that I simply just cannot be emphasized enough.\nThe benefits of this stretch far beyond just success in dating, relationships, business, networking, etc.\nI'm currently working with three guys who've all been struggling with depression (real fucking depression) their entire lives. They've been to psychologists, hypnotists, nlp experts to deal with the root cause and also a variety of dating coaches to try to mask the symptoms.\nYet to no avail.\nHowever, after just the first two months they all had a giant breakthrough, finally seeing beyond the surface layers of reality and started to find a true sense of who they are and where their happiness comes from.\nNot to mention how their friends are suddenly not only responding to them differently but even explicitly commenting on the changes in their energy and behavior.\nWhich lead me to another of these \"skills\": Pure communication abilities.\nI'm not gonna rant about this too much, because everyone knows how many years I've been obsessing over patterns and principles of communication.\nHowever, understanding the difference between high vibrational communication mastery and low vibrational is HUGE. But you won't even be able to feel/see it once you've done the internal work. Hence why that is the FIRST phase of the coaching and the first part of this article.\nI've made a few posts about communication in this group already, but I'm going to start sharing a little more, although 90% of my communication teachings are reserved for clients who successfully pass the first phase of the coaching. Reasons for this are abundant, one being you risk losing yourself if you don't have a solid base.\nThis can also be separated into several sub-categories, beginning with full understanding yourself as an archetype and learning how to communicate authentically based on who you truly are, as opposed to just copying and modeling whoever you think is cool or has \"results\".\nHence why so many introverts come to me after having tried to learn from naturally extroverted coaches but wondering why they get so 'drained' from socializing.\nOr why lots of guys who are naturally extremely agreeable come to me wondering why it's almost impossible to deal with conflict and boundaries in a calm but assertive way. This, again, is because most guys who like to teach boundaries are dudes who are drawn to it because it's on some level a natural behavior. (Some people are disagreeable by nature but still insecure, this means they'll grow up with weak boundaries but will learn it easily. Thus they like to teach it and will also teach it as an \"easy thing to learn\", while clients remain drained from just trying to copy this semi-naturals method of \"just don't be a nice guy\" or whatever.\nAfter this you have what PUAs and Red Pillers like to call \"SMV\", I prefer to just call it personal branding because, again, I approach this holistically and thus want this to carry over into business, networking, happiness, etc.\nSub-categories are fashion, fitness, grooming, and even sub-communication to some extent as well as your archetype.\nAnd then you have your life philosophy, which later will become the CULTURE you create in your next \"skill\" (systems). This is your development of VALUES. Things like systems thinking, seeing how there are truth and falsehood in all statements, nuanced thinking, understanding politics, religion, science, biology, history, etc. Understanding that if someone is a \"libtard\" that's good because there is truth to what they're saying too, and it's your job to find what they have to teach you about the world. Or if you're a CNN loving Bernie-fan then you must apply critical thinking when CNN rants on about how dumb Trump is, and find what Trump is right about and how CNN is spreading propaganda.\nBack in the day of the Samurai, you didn't just master the sword or the bow and arrow.\nYour swordsmanship was art. You held total presence, zen, when practicing. You master your emotions. You stay fully focused. And you express art and love through your sword. And old saying in Kung Fu goes: \"Ignore your Kung Fu for one day, and it ignores you for two\".\nBecoming a master martial ARTIST (artist of warfare) was a sacred art, and you had to become one with it. It was a spiritual path.\nBut more than that, the Samurai was also a poet, a painter, and a philosopher.\nThey learn to draw, write, read, think critically, understand politics, understand the customs of cultures, and some even studied other languages to learn to communicate with other nations/cultures better.\nWhen I was 13 years old I cried from watching a movie for the first time.\nIt was the first time a story touched something so deep within me that it brought me to tears.\nAnd we're not talking a few drops.\nWe're talking waterfalls. I was so touched and rattled I didn't speak to anyone for days.\nI couldn't communicate with anyone.\nThat movie was The Last Samurai, and today, as I'm writing this, I realize that 17 years later I've become a modern samurai of sorts, with the only difference that love/attraction/communication is my art, and not swordsmanship.\nInstead of becoming a martial artist, I became a Venusian artist.\nI didn't keep this movie, or the philosophies of the samurais in mind almost at all during these 14 years I've been a \"Venusian artist\".\nI just ended up with the same exact philosophy.\nAt 13 I didn't understand why, I just knew that they spoke about deeper truths than anything else I had ever been exposed to.\nAnd, after lots of failures, and slightly more successes, I can finally say that I really understand where those philosophies came from.\nSo, if anyone in this group doesn't have the means to do private coaching with me, since it's rather high-end and requires some serious commitment and financial investment, then here you have a map by someone who's spent virtually every single day, and almost every waken hour of those days, for the last 14 years obsessing over this.\nWrite this down.\nAll the main skills, and the sub-categories.\nAnd find habits to make sure you improve all main skills every single week.\nIt doesn't have to be a massive push every single day. But it should be a decent effort every week.\nOh, right, and the last skill?\nSystems.\nThese are basically social networks.\nSocial circles, rotations/harems, networks, business connections, etc.\nCreating weekly systems for you to maintain and deepen all current network, and finding out how to create \"compound interest\" from them.\nI like to use networks to connect people with other people. That's a very powerful skill. But that's just one of many tools. Most guys aren't at a place where they should even worry about how to make networks compound though. First, you should learn about acquiring and maintaining all the networks. Which the first skills provide you with. Then once you've got multiple solid networks it's time to make them work for you, either to get passive income, to make girls pick up other girls for you, or whatever it is you want to do with these skills.\nAs I said: The life you carve out with these skills is up to you.\nMaster the skills, and life is at your feet.\nBut, be patient. And approach it like a Samurai: With diligence, practice, mastery-focused approach, moral compass, and a legit mentor that you REALLY connect with.\nThat's all for now,\nTalk soon.",

We are a paradigm above that when we fully go into our masculine.\nThis is is why I keep harping on “being the witness”.\nBeing the witness means being able to let go of all your self-consciousness and fully SEE her.\nFull attention.\nWhen you do this you can sense it the second she starts playing.\nAnd you call it out.\nIt short circuits it.\nBecause she can’t hide. She can’t fake. She can’t front anymore.\nThis is very confronting and very intense for a women.\nBut if you hold this space while being grounded in a loving, compassionate, state of mind, she’ll melt and allow herself to let go of the games.\nAnd a much deeper level of intimacy can begin.\nAnd it can begin within an hour of meeting.\nIt’s extremely powerful, and it leads to a very intimate communion.\nLike this, just saying hello to a woman and having a chat in a bar, becomes a tantric practice.\nS&x, starts at hello.\nDon’t wait to get into the bedroom to penetrate her.

You go into their perspective 100%, as if you were them, with total understanding for everything and absolute acceptance of their point of view.\nThis isn’t just putting yourself in their shoes, not the way most people think of it anyway.\nIt’s understanding their perspective so well you can actually explain it better than they can themselves.\nAnd you actually feel it, and fully embrace their perspective for a moment.\nIt doesn’t mean you have to adopt their point of view forever, but you have to for a brief moment.\nWhen you can do this with women, for example, you can also fully understand all their insecurities, trust issues, and fears - with intense compassion.\nSometimes guys ask me how to see women less as objects and just trying to get laid, and develop a stronger sense of compassion and desire to really connect.\nWhen you fully understand a woman’s point of view, it’s hard not to melt and experience the desire to truly connect.\nWhen you can feel their softness, their tenderness, their heart, it becomes natural to want to cherish that and to be a strong, powerful, and benevolent force for good in her life.\nYou simply fall in love with Woman (capital ‘W’), and you can much more easily step into your role as a leader from a place of love and compassion.\nThis, gentlemen, is your masculine superpower.\nPerspective shifting.

    B: "“Welcome to the Jungle…”\nBeing an attractive man doesn’t have to be complicated.\nEverything can be summarized to one simple concept: Being Her Hero.\nThe archetypal hero. The meta hero. Her fucking Disney fantasy.\nBut being a hero isn’t easy.\nEvery guy reading this is thinking “yeah, I can be the hero”.\nAnd to an extent they’re all right. They do have the ability to become the hero.\nHowever, becoming a hero, embodying the meta hero, requires a level of sacrifice that most men simply aren’t willing to make.\nFirst of all, you have to understand that heroes aren’t made in the library.\nThey’re made on the battlefield.\nThey’re made in the cave of the dragon’s lair.\nThey’re made in the face of adversity.\nAnd it all begins with one word…\n...it all begins with “yes”.\nEvery adventure begins with saying yes.\nI know most men reading this will be thinking to themselves “yeah, I say yes to adventure”.\nBut you don’t.\nYou actually fucking don’t, dude.\nTruly saying yes requires you to think like an artist, to say Hallelujah to Life and all it’s opportunities.\nI’ve coached hundreds of men by this stage. Both in my old hardcore pickup artist days, and with these spiritual elements I use now.\nBut no matter what I teach, the biggest problem 99% of my students have, is that they don’t say ‘Yes’ to adventure.\nYou gotta understand that when you’re dealing with the Feminine, you’re in the fucking jungle homie.\nThis isn’t a temple of silence. This is chaos itself. It’s destructive, beautiful, and more powerful than you could ever imagine.\nShe’s going to cut your fucking head off if you bitch out.\nShe’s going to laugh at you while you hesitate and show weakness.\nAnd she’s going to submit to the asshole that made you look like a pussy.\nShe’s the human manifestation of Mother Nature herself.\nAnd she’s not here to play games.\nEither you man up or you go home and let the big boys play.\nBut here’s the thing though, the rules are this - no matter how ruthless the bitch is, you never stop loving her.\nSo, the question is then, can you dominate this ruthless bitch with a loving heart whilst also free of resentment?\nIf not, she’s going to chew you up and spit you out.\nWelcome to the Jungle, where weak men are weeded out for the benefit of all beings.\nImagine a gorgeous woman strutting down the street with that intense feminine walk only 1 in a 1000 women have.\nYou know the walk I’m talking about.\nSo hypnotic the whole world disappears.\nThere’s hardly anything more intimidating than this to a man.\nStreet fights against 5 other men. Speaking on stage in front of hundreds or thousands of people. Leaving your job and starting a business on a loan.\nIt all pales in comparison to saying yes to facing your inner dragons and risking getting your head chopped off by a woman like this.\nBecause you know, deep down, what it means…\nIt means she saw through you. She saw your weakness. And now you know it too.\nAnd so does everyone else on the street.\nShe is the mirror that makes you face your demons.\nAll of your insecurities and shadows. Made to resurface all at once.\nHeroes don’t fight on the sidelines. They’re not librarians and theoreticians.\nThey’re on the battlefield keeping their swords bloody.\nThey stay there. Not hiding from the enemy. But facing it. With a smile on their fucking face.\nYou gotta love getting your head chopped off.\nYou gotta love her for doing this.\nYou gotta love that this is for the benefit of all beings.\nAnd you have to love the good, the bad and the ugly that comes with dealing with the feminine.\nThis is how you become the hero. Get chewed up and spit back out. Then, without resentment or entitlement, you go do it again.\nAnd again.\nAnd again.\nAND AGAIN.\nUntil you’ve faced your demons and shadows so much that she doesn’t scare you anymore.\nYou see through the intimidating shell, and you see the innocent little girl inside that just needs you to love her, protect her, and play with her.\nYou see the girl she wishes men saw.\nAnd when you do this, she’ll let you in, while still chopping off the heads of all other men that fail to see through her.\nSo what am I actually saying here?\nI’m saying is this:\nYou must train yourself to say yes to what scares you.\nWhen I’m out with men who haven’t learnt this stuff there’s NON STOP bitching out.\nFirst when just starting a conversation.\nThen they bitch out as soon as the girl gives them a tiny bit of push back.\nThen they bitch out when they know they should kiss or make it sexual in some way.\nThen they btich out when it comes to inviting her home.\nThen they even bitch out there when it’s time to go to the bedroom.\nAnd then they even bitch out IN THE BEDROOM.\nBut not only that, but they even bitch out on INVITATIONS.\nSeriously.\nGuys decide to say no to joining an afterparty. They say no to joining a girl’s table in a club. They say no to following to another bar. Etc etc.\nI see guys all the time saying no to joining these types of things and instead being on their own.\nWhich is fine, of course. But that’s if you WANT to be on your own.\nI’m talking about guys that are paying me to teach them how to do this little dance we do.\nAnd then, while being out specifically because they want to meet women, they still say no.\nYou have to be okay with a sense of uncertainty.\nYou’re not going to learn how to meet women, or be a fucking Hero, by needing certainty all the damn time.\nYou have to take that leap of faith. Over, and over, and over again.\nThis is the way it works. You’ll never overcome your fears by staying inside your comfort zone.\nYou gotta be a wild motherfucker. There’s no other way around it.\nTo your future success, and may it be of benefit to all beings,\n- Pierre",

    B: "Do you lose girls that initially like you?\nDo girls lose attraction to you after a few months of dating?\nDoes a sense of inadequacy creep up whenever things start getting “real” with a girl?\nIf any of these things happen in your dating life, then this article is for you.\nToday we’ll discuss the subtle psychological mechanism that keep perpetuating this cycle of self-sabotage. Let’s get into it.\nListen. Why do you read/watch my content? Why do you/others spend money on my mentoring? Why do you want to master masculinity? Why do you want to stop feeling like a little boy and start feeling like a grown ass man?\nIt’s simple.\nBecause currently you’re experiencing various forms of suffering, and real mastery over masculine polarity IS the path out of suffering.\nLet me be extremely clear. I’m not about to tell you to stop desiring women.\nWhat we’re doing here is truly an integration of “serious” spirituality and “healthy” dating/sexuality.\nNow, when you have a good thing going, you’ll start experiencing the three horsemen of suffering: Craving, Clinging, and Aversion.\nThis may show up in many situations.\nMaybe you’re talking to a girl that you find absolutely gorgeous, with a stunning energy and she’s clearly attracted to you.\nMaybe you’ve met a girl in a park and a few hours later you’re at your house and you feel that you want to make things more intimate.\nMaybe it’s a girl you’ve been seeing for 2 months and now you’re starting to develop feelings for her.\nAnd now you’re afraid of losing the attraction/connection/relationship(s).\nMaybe this is something you went through today, this week, or at least this month. Hopefully you did, so you can follow along with this exercise.\nNotice the fear of losing her.\nNotice how you’re clinging to what you’re having.\nPay attention to that clinging.\nIt’s stressful, and even painful.\nDoesn’t it feel like shit?\nDoesn’t it make you unhappy?\nDoesn’t it make you powerless?\nExaaaaaactly, my friend.\nOf course is does. It’s clinging, and Clinging = Suffering.\nOk so imagine this…\nYou finally have what you are craving (a girl who’s into you on a date), but you’re STILL suffering! (That's what clinging does)\nHahahaha!\nGotta love how the mind always finds a way to screw a good thing up.\nAnyway…\nAs I said before, I’m not about to tell you to stop wanting women or stop pursuing masculinity. In fact, I’m about to tell you to start taking this a lot more seriously.\nHere’s the thing man, mastery of your masculine includes mastery over your relationship with the feminine - which includes penetrating the truths about ALL perceptions and sensations so that you can remain equanimous and grounded no matter what.\nThis means: Never letting the feminine shake you off your center and enter craving, clinging, aversion. But to remain in equanimity at all times.\nClinging makes you anxious and ungrounded. Which, in case you haven’t already worked out, is unattractive to the feminine.\nShe/she doesn’t want a man who is afraid of losing Her/her.\nAs a result you de-polarize your sexual polarity so that the feminine stops feeling drawn to you.\nSo, what in the holy fuck do we do then?\nI’m glad you asked!\nWe watch. We observe. We witnesssss…\nWhy?\nSimply because we are the Witness. That’s the masculine. The watcher, the observer, the awareness.\nThat which was never born, that which will never die, that which is ever-present, never-changing, and forever seeing.\nWithout trying to tie the feminine down (clinging), without needing the feminine (craving), and without closing down in the face of the feminine’s wrath (aversion).\nDoes this sound familiar?\nWanting to tie someone down into a relationship? Needing a relationship? Being afraid of harsh criticism?\nSound like your average HERO?\nProbably not.\nSound like just about every feminine woman you know?\nExactly.\nIt’s feminine.\nWe gotta move beyond this stuff so we can reside in our masculine, and thus being the counterpart to feminine women.\nSo that they can trust us, love us, lean on us, heal us, and surrender to us.\nTo master this, check out The Return of the Sage 2.0.\nDropping in a couple of weeks.\nEverything I’ve learnt in the last 15 years of understanding masculine & feminine polarities so you can master dating and sexuality in a truly holistic fashion.\nThis is an approach designed to make the entire world better.\nIt’s an approach that’s good for your mind, good for your soul, good for your body; Good for everyone you meet, good for the entire planet, and good for the Universe as a Whole.\nThis is unlike anything you’ve ever seen, I guarantee you that.\nThis will change not just how you view women and sexuality, but your true self and the entire world.\nThis will be the most pivotal decision you’ve ever made.",

    B: "Do you love Her?\nDo you have the balls to dive into uncertainty with an open heart?\nThis is the most important question you could ever ask yourself, if you want to figure out why you’re not attractive to the Feminine.\nThere are two core things to understand when it comes to ballistic self-expression.\nCan you get triggered?Do you need certainty before expressing yourself?\nIf you answer yes to any of those questions, then you need to learn to love the feminine more.\nYou need to learn how to allow the feminine to make your heart sing no matter what she throws at you.\nLet’s dive into these a bit deeper.\nSo, firstly, can you get triggered, and, furthermore, how easily can you get triggered? Not to mention, when you get triggered, how deeply do you get triggered and how long does it take you to move through the trigger?\nBeing triggered is an instant turn off for the feminine. Anger, jealousy, shyness, etc. It’s gross. It’s insulting.\nWhen I see guys trying to talk to girls and then get triggered by girls being girls is just sad. It makes me so sad for the girls. They’re just listening to their own nature and being honest, and in return guys get angry and weird and shy. Very very sad.\nOn the other hand, when she can’t trigger you, she becomes naturally drawn to you.\nWhen she can’t intimidate you, she becomes naturally attracted to you.\nWhen she can’t make you nervous, you make her nervous (in a good way).\nThis is why you have to master how to remain in a state of deep love for the feminine while remaining in your masculine polarity (so you remain unreactive in your love).\nSecondly, do you need certainty?\nThe need for certainty is FEAR OF THE FEMININE.\nThe feminine is chaos, aka uncertainty. If you need certainty before expressing yourself then you’re basically asking her to be your mommy.\nNeed to know what to say next? Need to find out if that dude she’s with is her boyfriend before approaching? Need to find out what she looks like without sunglasses before expressing attraction/intent/desire?\nYou’re being a coward.\nThe kind of man the feminine desires to weed out of existence.\nSorry. I know it stings. But it’s the truth, and you must learn to Love this truth. We all NEED you to level up and transcend your fearfulness and selfishness so that you can love fearlessly no matter what. That’s the purpose of her ruthlessness. It’s for the benefit of all beings.\nBallistic energy, or masculine energy, happens when you truly let the chips fall where they may.\nFor example, when I see an attractive woman, I tend to just open my mouth and start a sentence with whatever words arises first, and then hopefully I got a decent way of finishing the sentence.\nIt’s a complete letting of control and certainty. I just swing. I see a woman, I feel the inspiration to connect, and I allow ‘the muse’ to speak through me.\nNo plans. No perception management. Just pure masculine self-expression inspired by beauty.\nOf course, this is a lot easier said than done.\nBut it’s 100% doable and you can learn to do it fairly quickly.\nBut, it’s NOT easy.\nYou can learn it quickly.\nAnd it’s simple.\nBut it is far from easy.",

Lead HARD. But lead with a RADICAL level of love.\nThis is dangerous, however.\nBecause if you lean to far into pure love, you risk neglecting REAL trauma and you also risk neglect both Growing Up and remaining in your masculine.\nWhen you merge with Love you enter your feminine.\nYou become too impulsive, too much movement, neglecting your rational & planning mind (part of the masculine), and you forget the emptiness and stillness that is the masculine polarity.\nBut, still, we lead with DEEP love for her.\nAbsolutely radical levels of love and open, transparent, AUTHENTICITY.\nThis creates a level of trust that allows for her to sink into her feminine (pure Love) so that she can love until she dissolves.\nBut for this to happen without fucking her up, you MUST do everything in your power to remain CLEAN and to never let her put you on a pedestal.\nDon’t succumb to your shadows that desire for her to treat you like a superhuman masculine hero.\nYou’re just a person and she must know this.\nShe doesn’t surrender to “you”.

It truly isn’t.\nConstant need for more and more approval and gross attention.\nHowever, if you stop at this level of perspective you end up in the same unhealthy level but in the masculine counterpart.\nJust being the cold, judgemental, masculine.\nSitting on your imaginary thrown, casting judgement.\nForgetting that as a King you’re responsible for the culture of your kingdom.\nWomen across the globe are yearning, longing, desperately crying for some deep masculine attention.\nBut, being the feminine, they mostly don’t know it.\nSelf-awareness is an inherently masculine trait, but RP etc don’t realize this and get stuck judging the feminine for its lack of self awareness.\nTake a step back and look at your own perspective.\nYou are the one leading. Or supposedly so, anyway.\nShe needs a man who can look beyond the physical body and PENETRATE her physical body, subtle body (mind, emotions), her causal body (soul), and all the way into Spirit.\nShe needs a man who can bring her back Home.\nSomeone who can make her feel complete by simply saying, “I gotchu, babe”.\nMasculine leadership isn’t happening unless you’re penetrating all the way into the core of who she is.\nNot allowing any of her chaos to cause reactivity.\nI repeat.\nNot allowing any of her chaos to cause reactivity.\nOne more time.\nNot allowing any of her chaos to cause reactivity.\nIf you don’t learn to see past the gross (physical) dimension of her into the subtle, women will not stop using their bodies for attention.\nAnd once we, as a collective, get to the subtle level, we’ll all get stuck there until we, as a collective, get frustrated with not having our Souls penetrated and connected.\nAnd then we’ll get stuck there until we get frustrated if not going all the way into Spirit and nonduality. But that’s probably at least 500 years away for the collective to get to this level of problem.\nWomen all over the world are already telling you this!\nThey want you to see them as more than a body.\nBut you don’t.\nAnd then you wonder why they show sexy pics on Tinder.\nYou think it’s hypocritical.\nIT IS NOT.\nThey literally tell you:\nI WISH I DIDNT HAVE TO POST HALF NAKED PICS BUT YOU DONT GIVE ME ATTENTION OTHERWISE AND I WILL LITERALLY DIE WITHOUT AT LEAST SOME MASCULINE ATTENTION.\nMy heart is bleeding and crying for the poor souls. They NEED us to wake up to their inner beauty as much as their outer.\nNot in the dumb “body doesn’t matter” way. Let’s appreciateher physical beauty too. But let’s learn to penetrate deeper. Connect deeper. And to overcome our addiction to pure physical stimulation and bring true intimacy into our human society. The entire world needs us to wake up to this. We will literally end warfare and cruelty if we start to wake up to true intimacy.\nIt’s not a lot of things I get passionate about these days. Most of my old desires have left this psychology.\nBut something that still make my HEART pulsate is the idea of possibly nudging some humans into the direction of really clean and mature intimacy.\nWhere you can be a MAN, she can be a WOMAN, and we can find some actual MEANING AND FULFILMENT through intimacy. Some God, through intimacy.\nIf this resonates with you, I’d love to have the honor to help you on this journey. Because most men have not gotten to a point where this resonates yet, and the ones of us who are further ahead can really make a difference by leaning into it and leading by example. More will follow, but pioneers and visionaries must lead first.\nAnd no, it doesn’t make any of us “special” or “better”. It just means that society evolves through some people “upgrading” their perspectives and practices earlier than others. It just is what it is.\nBut, it does feel pretty damn incredible to be “on the other side” of this thing and to get to explore intimacy through real, clean, polarity that honors to differences of men and women while still operating from deep, deep, love and compassion.\nWe can really clean up the world a little bit by doing this.\nHope this post gives you a good perspective, maybe some new nuances of feminine and masculine, inspires you slightly, and resonates with your values.\nIf it does, and you’re ready to do real, deep, meaningful work together with me, then I’d like to gently invite you to join the online program. I will begin taking on a small new batch of clients again after closing the doors for a few months. More info coming soon.\nMuch love,\nPierre",

And some have a decent idea of why to do it.\nThe biggest challenge usually surrounds the ability to do it with trust in themselves, with trust that others won’t ridicule them over it, and that women won’t leave them/reject them because they didn’t do it perfectly.\nThe VAST majority of problems with dating, sex, and relationships come down to the inability to:\n1. Fully relax and trust that you’re good enough\n2. Expressing yourself unapologetically\n3. Empathy and awareness of other people’s emotional state and “vibe” (aka reading the room and “calibration”\n4. Leading in a firm but gentle way from a loving place without overcompensating\n5. Allowing yourself to be playful and goofy, instead of being rigid and stiff because you’re trying to be “stoic”/alpha (alpha males don’t worry about being alpha)\nTattoo this on your forehead if you need to.\nYou don’t need to learn every technique in the book. It’s enough to just develop solid, masculine, confident communication and energy.\nOf course this is easier said than done, but it’s still a whole lot easier than faking your way into relationships based on building an external shell.\nThe way I teach this is through a myriad of very unique meditative, contemplative, social, and subconscious strategies and this new hypnotherapy modality in learning.\nAnd the results speak for themselves.\nDM if you want to do this work with me in 2022.\n1:1 mentorship will be off the market for a year as of January once I’ve decided the second person to join, one was decided today due to being an absolutely perfect client.

Not by controlling, but by being present and trusting in your intuitive abilities to handle whatever arises.\nAnd then add some very basic communication strategies, as a way of AMPLIFYING your polarity, not as a substitute.\nThis, my friends, is absolute fucking MAGIC!",

    B: "If other men look up to you and tend to get tentative around you, women want you.\nThis is one of those topics that are not only controversial but also messes with some guys' heads.\nSo let's clarify this real quick.\nYou can have other men be tentative around you by being a bully and intimidating men with sheer physical size and scaring people.\nThis is highly egocentric, immature, and will attract friends and women at the same level of maturation. It works. It really does, but your life will be filled with drama and bullshit.\nI have a friend in Stockholm who just got out of prison. He sleeps with 1-5 new women per week. He's got that figured out. They're way \"out of his league too\".\nI know he's not lying because he used to live with me and I mentored him back in the day and taught him all the dark shit I used to do. I've seen him apply it and he's really hardcore with implementing.\nNow, here's the other side of the coin though...\nHe texts me constantly asking for how to deal with depression, why women are such absolute wh*res, etc.\nHe keeps making friends with people that are similar to him, and they just attract fights, drama, and bad people all around.\nHe's got a SHIT life.\nThen there's another way...\nYou can be that \"alpha\" guy while being highly competent at life. Successful, charismatic, etc, but still a good person.\nGuys will be a bit tentative around you simply because they look up to you and want to be liked by you. They wanna be like you and they wanna be your friend.\nAnd then there are distinctions and levels even here.\nYou can be completely on the lookout for yourself, or you can be very focused on love and how your words and action are beneficial to not only yourself, but those you come in contact with AND the planet as a whole.\nLevels and levels and levels.\nThere are many levels that get you laid.\nBut the lower levels get you laid, full stop. Nothing else. Except drama.\nHigher levels get you girls, happiness, high quality friends and connections, a better life, and a sense of meaning.\nDon't stare yourself blind at just ONE metric!\nIt's a fallacy. It's a trap. Think farther than JUST your dick.",

I mean FUCKING RELAX. Guys text me telling me they have mastered relaxation but still not getting attention from women right, left, and center.\nNo, you've attempted a bit of relaxation. That's all.\nI'm talking about profound levels of relaxation.\nEye lids. Lips. Cheeks. YOUR MIND. Shoulders. Fingers. YOUR FUCKING TOES AND YOUR ASSHOLE. Lower back. Relax your damn ears dude.\nEverything.\nThis require HOURS OF DAILY FOCUSED PRACTICE while approaching women that serious intimidate you.\nThis is how you practice.\nNot like a pussy.\nYou apply this level of practice on all the five principles while doing deep belief and identity dismantling to rebuild a stronger, more robust, more loving and inclusive, more masculine, more dominant, new idenitity and belief ecology.\nYou build an entirely new inner ecology of beliefs, thoughts, mindsets, emotional wiring, and understanding of the feminine.\nWhile embodying the 5 principles.\nDo this and you'll be head and shoulders above what you thoughts possible.\nAnd you'll be able to let of of cognitive persuasion forever if you so wish, and just fully be yourself. Just owning your truth and being enough that way.\nIf you want me to gently, yet aggressively, kindly, yet sternly, slowly, yet impatiently, guide you toward this place - shoot me a DM and let's chat.\nEnjoy the rest of your weekend!\n- Pierre",

I think I have a chance, but I’m not certain.\nSo instead of taking my chances and risking him losing precious time, I send him to the #1 expert that I know of for this particular issue. (DM me if you have tried everything to solve ED/PE but nothing worked, if you have solid personal finances and need ED/PE solved this will do it, it’s expensive but it works. I also don’t even know the dude, he doesn’t know me, I just know this through knowing this industry very well that this is THE dude for these things).\nI did this because it’s more important that he gets his issue loved with the best choice available than me getting a chance to solve it just so I can get another client.\nThis is harder to do than most non business owners understand. When you have staff to pay, licenses, softwares, advertising, consultants, etc.\nHowever, compassion tells me this is the right thing.\nI do this quite a lot too (with a lot I don’t mean it’s like a daily or weekly thing, but it is a monthly occurrence).\nWhat’s the result of this?\nA lot of trust.\nSo when I do tell him I can solve something else for him, he trusts me.\nThis is the same in all areas of life.\nIf you make a decision to lead with ‘Benevolent Masculinity’, aka compassion, people know they can trust you.\nAnd trust is one of the cornerstones for being a leader. Without trust you got nothing.\nBut this isn’t even the biggest payoff..\nThe biggest payout is that compassion creates inner peace.\nYou feel incredibly peaceful, happy, content, and free from stress when you tap into compassion.\nYou don’t even need money, status, etc to feel fulfilled anymore. That stuff is just a bonus.\n(Within reason, of course, we need money to take care of needs, but the greediness dissipates.)\nAnyway, probably not much new here, but a little reminder for myself and hopefully for someone else too.\nHave a great day, I wish you happiness and peace,\n- Pierre",

    B: "Male suicide is an epidemic.\nIt’s atrocious.\nAnd a lot of it comes due to shaming and guilt tripping men for both their biological nature as well as when they try to open up and do softer work on themselves.\nIf you’re serious about doing something meaningful here then you MUST be the change you want to see.\nStop judging and ridiculing other men when they embrace more softness, when they enjoy fashion, when they tell other male friends they love them, when they ask for support, etc.\nAll this macho bravado stuff is adding to an existing epidemic.\nWe must be more careful with our word and how we joke amongst each other.\nIt’s time to evolve out of the emotionally constipated way of being a man and start to step into a masculinity that also includes and embraces its inner feminine at the same time.\nI love you all.\nAnd if anyone needs help with emotional and psychological well being, I will start travelling and doing “house calls” soon.\nCurrently doing “free bootcamps” with existing clients as customer service. Soon will be expanding this outward.\nI’ll be leaning more and more toward free work where you just make sure I have a place to sleep (floor is enough), food, water, coffee, and a gym. And then I’ll come to your city and help you with meditation, hypnosis work, overcoming fear of approaching women, developing more love and compassion in your mind, etc. I’ll ask for a donation but if all you can do is a hug and a smile that’s plenty enough too.\nKeep updated in the group and I’ll let you know when I expand this outside of existing client",

    B: "Every time someone asks you a question you can take that as an opportunity to truly share who you are, or you can answer in a bland and lazy manner that says nothing about you.\nYou can respond with passion and vitality, or you can just stand there, concerned about if the other person likes you or not.\nBeing an interesting person isn’t difficult. It’s just about sharing who you actually are without worrying about what people think of you.\n(Now, actually achieving this level of emotional mastery, THAT, is for some people a tougher journey, but the actual verbal component doesn’t have to be overcomplicated!)",

    B: "If you’re unsure about how to meet a woman: Keep it simple.\nApproach everyone who intimidates you for a year. Focus on relaxation and being direct.\nAs you become more and more comfortable you can develop more playfulness and flirtatious energy.\nUntil then keep it simple.\nDirect approach, share what you’re doing with your life, ask her some simple questions to get to know her, grab her phone number and set up a date.\nDo this. Lots of times. And eventually you’ll be very comfortable with it and through confidence + being “normal” you’ll actually end up having a ton of dates.\nWith experience you’ll develop your own sense of humor and flirtatiousness.\nSlowly but surely you’ll develop a life of abundance with women.\nTrust in the process.\nJust don’t forget that abundance with women is NOT going to make you happy.\nBut neither is scarcity, so why not go out there and shoot your shot?",

    B: "Meeting women is easy, very easy.\nBut only once you’ve made it so.\nUntil it becomes easy it will seem almost impossible.\nWhy?\nBecause of the unforgiving nature of nature.\nWomen cannot give out participation trophies.\nSo, when you’re KIND OF ”there” you’d still get basically nothing.\nAnd then suddenly you just start being able to meet women and you quickly find yourself in a world of abundance (if you keep doing your thing and don’t into relationship, that is).\nThat why it’s important to understand the subtle signs of progress so that you can see that you’re actually moving forward.\nSo let’s go through a few important sign posts along the way. And let’s begin from the absolute beginning.\nFrom 0-100\n0: You can’t even say hello to a woman. Crippling approach anxiety. You’re on the sidelines. This is THE most important stage to overcome because nothing good ever happens here, ever.\nBiggest challenge: Becoming okay with rejection, looking creepy, looking nervous, being seen getting rejected, taking a hit on your ego, etc.\nKey to success: Changing your perspective of failing. Understanding the concept of Tactical Failing and utilizing hypnosis & meditation to get control over your actions and mind.\n1: Can’t open a conversation. You’re approaching but it’s mainly instant blowouts. People don’t stop to speak to you. Most likely you’re too nervous, giving off signals of being weird, and/or dressing in a way that makes people think you’re weird.\nBiggest challenge: Emotional mastery.\nKey to success: Desensitization and finding someone who can point out if you’re doing anything that’s weird or off putting. Understand Eye contact, Energy level, Proximity, Pressure On vs Off, and a basic and straightforward way to begin the conversation. Keep things VERY simple here. Just a direct or neutral approach. Nothing indirect or advanced if you’re stuck here.\n2: Opening wel but people leave after 1-5 minutes. This is because you’re either boring or weird.\nBiggest challenge: Finding out the reason why people leave. Are you weird or boring? If weird: Slow down and stop trying to do things. This is a common place for PUAs and Red Pillers to be stuck for a looong time because they think they have to DO so much to be enough. If you’re a more “normal” guy then you’re probably just a little boring which is easier to correct since you only need a LITTLE bit of excitement to be engaging enough.\nKey: Hypnotherapy to heal your anxieties, repeated exposure to become more relaxed in the situation, and some basic conversational training on creating Depth vs Width in your rapport, as well as emotional impact training.\n3: People “hook” but it remains platonic and whenever it’s time to actually move thing into a sexual, romantic, etc direction people resist.\nBiggest challenge: Develop an air of authority and calm confidence that invites respect and attraction, as opposed to just attention.\nKey: Becoming comfortable with tension, not rushing. Guys stuck here tend to avoid tension in conversations as well as try to rush to collecting numbers or trying to pull because they don’t have confidence in their conversational abilities. You gotta learn to sit comfortably in dynamic conversation where you create both Depth and Tension.\n4: Deep hooks but not pulling. This is due to lack of trust and connection. Possibly investment issues as well.\nChallenge: Being very REAL. Showing vulnerability without coming off as ”too emotional” or weird, ”over sharing”, etc.\nKey: Developing emotional intelligence and NOT thinking about this like a robot. Also pay close attention to people’s emotional responses to when you open up and learn what’s too much and what’s too little. This may need an expert eye to look at and help you understand. This could feel very tricky if you grew up without this emotional intelligence\n5: Pulling home, being intimate, but never going all the way. This is due to something feeling off, feeling rushed, feeling inauthentic, or something else along those lines.\nChallenge: Pin pointing the actual root cause\nKey: Having someone really advanced around to be able to help you. Possibly a matter of plenty of hypnotherapy work if it’s due to a sense of inadequacy causing you to give of nervous/rushed energy.\n6: Going all the way but girls not seeing you again. Very frustrating stage, also a place some guys get stuck in forever, especially if coming from a highly technical place.\nChallenge: Developing a fully congruent and authentic self that doesn’t get weird during or after sex. Also becoming good in the bedroom.\nKey: Repetition until you feel comfortable. Also developing a personality outside of techniques if that’s your problem. Don’t rely too heavily of techniques because you risk girls feeling the inauthenticity coming off of you during or after sex\n7: Girls coming back but things quickly ending or you completely ruining the dynamic and her running the show\nThis is largely a polarity and/attachment issue. Therapy, meditation, masculinity training needed here.\n8: Relationships becoming stale or overly hectic. Polarity + Attchment issue as well. Therapy, serious meditation practice, authentic relating, and suprasexual training (“Tantra”), etc.\nThe relationship component is an entire world in and of itself so I’m just making this one point but don’t think that’s because this is the easy part. This is wheee 80% of your growth will happen. The courtship is just the warm up. Don’t fall into the pickup myths of thinking relationships is the comfort zone. Serious relationship work is extremely challenging.\nLast note: This is a VERY rough guideline. But this is essentially the pattern I’ve noticed in hundreds and hundreds of clients, friends, and in my own journey since I got into this stuff 15+ years ago.\nGood luck on your journey and hope this provided some insight!\nI be expanding on all the stages in the upcoming offer in an effort to make my training available for anyone who needs it. No matter your financial position. Still working on details! Stay tuned!",
